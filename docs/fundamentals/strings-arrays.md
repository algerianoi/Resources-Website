# Strings & Arrays

Understanding **strings** and **arrays** is essential in programming contests and problem solving.  
This page gathers tutorials, guided exercises, and problem sets to help you master them.

## 💡 Tips

- Prefer `std::string`, `std::vector`, over arrays unless required.  
- Always check bounds when working with arrays or strings.  
- Debug with small test cases before tackling larger inputs.  
- Use `getline()` when you need to read full lines with spaces instead of plain `cin`.  
- Learn key `std::string` methods: `.size()`, `.substr()`, `.find()`, `.push_back()`.  
- Familiarize yourself with useful STL algorithms: `sort`, `reverse`, `min_element`, `max_element`, `accumulate`.  
- Remember: arrays have fixed size, but `vector` grows dynamically—use accordingly.  
- Practice different loop styles: range-based loops and indexed loops each have their use cases.  
- For performance, pass large strings or vectors by **`const &`** reference, not by value.
