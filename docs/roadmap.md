# The AOI Roadmap

This roadmap is a **recommended learning path** for AOI students who want to gradually build their competitive programming and problem-solving skills.  

⚠️ **Important:**  

- Focus on **problem-solving skills** more than rushing to advance in the roadmap.  
- Make sure your **basics are strong** before moving on.  
- You are not obliged to complete the whole roadmap — it is just a **suggestion of what to do next**.  
- **Practice a lot** — solving problems consistently is the most effective way to improve.  
- Learn to **write clean solutions and explain your reasoning** — clarity is as important as correctness.  
- Always review your mistakes and **analyze why a solution failed** — this is where the real learning happens.

## Final Tips

- **Consistency beats intensity**: Solve a few problems every day rather than cramming.  
- **Mix topics**: Don’t stay stuck on only one topic for months; revisit earlier phases to reinforce them.  
- **Balance theory and practice**: Understanding algorithms is important, but solving problems under time pressure matters more.  
- **Compete often**: Join Codeforces, AtCoder, and AOI contests regularly to measure your progress.  
- **Discuss with peers**: Teaching or explaining a solution to a friend helps you deeply understand it.  
- **Don’t fear hard problems**: Even if you can’t solve them, trying will push your thinking forward.  

> 🚀 Remember: becoming strong at problem-solving is not about how **fast** you progress through the roadmap, but how **deeply** you understand and apply each step.
