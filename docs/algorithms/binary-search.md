# Binary Search on Arrays

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the left half; otherwise, it continues on the right half. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the interval is empty.
Its time complexity is $O(\log n)$, making it much faster than linear search for large arrays.

Raouf's note : Focus well on choosing the middle index, because it may lead to an infinite loop if not done properly. Details are well discussed in the resources below.
