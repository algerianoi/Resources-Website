# Two Pointers & Sliding Window

Two Pointers is a technique where we maintain two indices (often `l` and `r`) that move over the array or string.  
Sliding Window is a special case applied to **contiguous subarrays**: we expand with one pointer, and contract with the other, depending on constraints.  

This transforms many naive $O(n^2)$ solutions into $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$ with proper data structures.
