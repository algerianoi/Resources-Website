# Tries (Prefix trees)

A **Trie** (also called a *prefix tree*) is a tree-based data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve strings based on their prefixes.
It can also be adapted for **bitwise operations** — for example, finding the maximum XOR of two numbers by building a binary trie over their bits.
